# Option
My first small project for a company. The project was written at the request of the company to improve its internal work. At the time of writing the project, I didn't know much that I know now, but the project proved to me that I can write web applications for companies even now. I did the development myself and I myself communicated with the customer. At the end of development, the application was released on the company's server using IIS.

## Contributing
For help in development, please contact me via my e-mail. The subject for help can be a bug or suggestions for improving the code, adding new options for the development of the application.

## Why was this project developed?
The project was created to gain commercial experience in development. During the writing of the application, I understood how to work with the customer, and also gained experience in writing my own web application. The project also gave me the skills to publish the project on servers using IIS.
