## Contributing
For help in development, please contact me via my e-mail. The subject for help can be a bug or suggestions for improving the code, adding new options for the development of the application.

## Why was this project developed?
The project was created to gain commercial experience in development. During the writing of the application, I understood how to work with the customer, and also gained experience in writing my own web application. The project also gave me the skills to publish the project on servers using IIS.
